1. What is Goofile?

Goofile is an OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tool that uses Google search queries to find publicly accessible files of specific types (e.g., PDF, DOCX, XLS, PPT, TXT, etc.) on a given domain.

It helps penetration testers and security researchers discover sensitive information leakage without directly touching the targetâ€™s infrastructure.

2. Why use it?
	â€¢	Identify sensitive documents exposed on the internet.
	â€¢	Discover metadata leaks (e.g., usernames, software versions in file properties).
	â€¢	Collect reconnaissance information before an attack (red team).
	â€¢	Check your own organization for unintended file exposure (blue team).

3. How does Goofile work?
	1.	Takes a target domain and a file extension type.
	2.	Sends Google queries like:

site:target.com filetype:pdf


	3.	Scrapes and lists the results (URLs of discovered files).
	4.	Analyst can then manually review or download these files.

4. Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

goofile -d example.com -f pdf

Sample Output (Example):

[+] Searching for files: pdf
http://www.example.com/documents/policy.pdf
http://www.example.com/reports/financial-report.pdf

Interpretation:
	â€¢	Found PDF files hosted on example.com.
	â€¢	These documents may contain metadata (author names, software versions) â†’ could aid social engineering or vulnerability research.

5. Practical Workflow
	â€¢	Search for PDFs:

goofile -d target.com -f pdf

	â€¢	Search for Word docs:

goofile -d target.com -f docx

	â€¢	Search for Excel sheets:

goofile -d target.com -f xls

	â€¢	Search for all types (loop through multiple):

for ext in pdf docx xls ppt txt; do goofile -d target.com -f $ext; done

6. Limitations
	â€¢	Relies on Google search results â†’ requires internet and may be rate-limited.
	â€¢	If Google blocks automated queries, results may fail.
	â€¢	Only finds indexed files (not hidden or blocked by robots.txt).
	â€¢	Cannot directly download files â€” only lists their links.

7. Summary
	â€¢	What: Goofile searches Google for publicly exposed files on a domain.
	â€¢	Why: Helps identify sensitive documents and metadata leaks.
	â€¢	How: Automates site:domain filetype:ext queries.
	â€¢	Use Case: On example.com, it could list PDFs, DOCs, or spreadsheets available online.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
Goofile = A Google hacking tool for quick reconnaissance of exposed files.
Great for OSINT & pentesting, but limited by Googleâ€™s indexing and query restrictions.
