	1.	What is dotdotpwn?
dotdotpwn is a directory traversal fuzzer that tests whether a target web or network service is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (../etc/passwd). It works against HTTP, FTP, TFTP, SMB, and local files.

‚∏ª
	2.	Why use it?

	‚Ä¢	Detect directory traversal vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Attempt to read sensitive files like /etc/passwd (Linux) or boot.ini (Windows).
	‚Ä¢	Useful for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

‚∏ª
	3.	How does dotdotpwn work?

	1.	Takes a hostname + vulnerable parameter endpoint.
	2.	Generates thousands of traversal payloads (slashes, backslashes, URL-encoded).
	3.	Sends them to the server.
	4.	Checks if known keywords (e.g., ‚Äúroot‚Äù in /etc/passwd) appear in responses.

‚∏ª
	4.	Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dotdotpwn -m http -h example.com -u /index.php?page= -k passwd

Observed Output:
	‚Ä¢	Target: example.com (Port 80)
	‚Ä¢	Total Payloads: 11,028
	‚Ä¢	Results:
	‚Ä¢	Multiple 403 Forbidden responses for /../../etc/passwd and /../../etc/issue.
	‚Ä¢	Multiple 404 Not Found responses for encoded backslash payloads.

Interpretation:
	‚Ä¢	No traversal vulnerability detected.
	‚Ä¢	Server is correctly blocking attempts to read sensitive files.

‚∏ª
	5.	Practical Workflow

	‚Ä¢	Test HTTP parameter:

dotdotpwn -m http -h target.com -u /vuln.php?file= -k passwd

	‚Ä¢	Test FTP:

dotdotpwn -m ftp -h target.com

	‚Ä¢	Test TFTP:

dotdotpwn -m tftp -h target.com

	‚Ä¢	Generate payloads only:

dotdotpwn -m stdout

‚∏ª
	6.	Limitations

	‚Ä¢	Old tool, slower compared to modern fuzzers (ffuf, wfuzz).
	‚Ä¢	May generate many false positives if keyword is too generic.
	‚Ä¢	Some WAFs/IDS block traversal attempts immediately.

‚∏ª
	7.	Summary

	‚Ä¢	What: dotdotpwn fuzzes for directory traversal vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Why: To check if a web app/server allows access to restricted files.
	‚Ä¢	How: Sends thousands of traversal payloads (../) and looks for success indicators.
	‚Ä¢	Use Case: example.com blocked all attempts (403/404), meaning no vulnerability found.

‚∏ª

üëâ In short:
dotdotpwn = good for legacy labs & CTFs, but in real-world pentests, testers often prefer ffuf, gobuster, or wfuzz for faster directory traversal + file discovery.
