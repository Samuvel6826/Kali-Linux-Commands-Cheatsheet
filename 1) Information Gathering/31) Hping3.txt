1. What is hping3?

hping3 is a network tool and packet crafter that allows users to send custom TCP/IP packets and analyze responses.
It can mimic ping, perform traceroutes, test firewall rules, benchmark networks, and even generate DoS/DDoS traffic in controlled environments.

⸻

2. Why use it?
	•	✅ Network testing – test connectivity, MTU discovery, latency.
	•	✅ Firewall/IDS testing – see how firewalls react to custom traffic.
	•	✅ Traceroute alternative – uses TCP instead of ICMP for mapping routes.
	•	✅ Traffic generation – simulate floods (TCP, UDP, ICMP) for stress testing.
	•	✅ Security audits – detect weaknesses in packet filtering and server resilience.

3. How does hping3 work?
	1.	User specifies packet type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, RAW-IP).
	2.	User sets flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST) and ports.
	3.	hping3 sends crafted packets at chosen speeds.
	4.	Responses are analyzed (or ignored if doing flood).

It essentially gives low-level control over packet crafting beyond normal ping or curl.

4. Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command (sending SYN flood to a local Node.js server):

sudo hping3 -S --flood -p 3000 127.0.0.1

Explanation:
	•	-S → set SYN flag (simulate opening TCP connections).
	•	--flood → send as fast as possible (DoS flood).
	•	-p 3000 → Node.js server port.
	•	127.0.0.1 → local machine (safe).

Observed Behavior:
	•	🔹 Node.js server may stop responding (hangs due to too many half-open connections).
	•	🔹 System resource usage spikes (CPU/sockets).
	•	🔹 When stopped, server resumes normal behavior.

👉 Interpretation: This shows how easily a server can be overwhelmed without protections.

5. Practical Workflow
	•	Simple ping with TCP SYN:

hping3 -S -p 80 example.com

	•	Traceroute using TCP SYN packets:

hping3 --traceroute -S -p 80 example.com

	•	UDP flood (lab test only):

sudo hping3 --udp --flood -p 3000 127.0.0.1

	•	ICMP flood:

sudo hping3 --icmp --flood 127.0.0.1

	•	Firewall testing (sending FIN packets):

hping3 -F -p 80 example.com


⸻

6. Limitations
	•	❌ Requires root privileges for raw packet crafting.
	•	❌ Can easily cause DoS if misused on production targets (illegal).
	•	❌ Generates large traffic loads → can overwhelm networks.
	•	❌ Not stealthy – IDS/IPS will detect it.

⸻

7. Constraints (Important Legal Note)
	•	⚠️ Using hping3 against external systems without permission = illegal attack.
	•	✅ Safe to use on your own lab servers (like local Node.js) for stress testing.
	•	Recommended to only publish results using public safe domains (like example.com) or lab IPs.

⸻

8. Summary
	•	What: hping3 crafts and sends custom TCP/UDP/ICMP packets for testing.
	•	Why: To check firewall rules, detect filtering, stress-test systems, or perform traceroute.
	•	How: By generating packets with specific flags and monitoring responses.
	•	Use Case: A Node.js server under SYN flood hangs → highlights the need for protections like rate limiting, reverse proxies, and WAFs.

⸻

👉 In short:
hping3 = Swiss Army knife of packet crafting & DoS simulation.
Excellent for network testing, firewall audits, and lab-based resilience experiments, but dangerous if misused.
