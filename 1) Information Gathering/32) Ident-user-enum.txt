âœ… Acknowledgement Report: ident-user-enum â€“ Ident Service User Enumeration Tool (Kali Linux)

1. What is ident-user-enum?

ident-user-enum is a simple Perl-based tool that queries the Ident service (TCP port 113) to determine the operating system user account associated with processes listening on specified TCP ports on a target system. ï¿¼ ï¿¼

2. Why Use ident-user-enum?
	â€¢	Identify Process Owners: Helps you discover which user account (like root, apache, or others) is running a particular service.
	â€¢	Attack Prioritization: Services running under privileged accounts like root often present higher-value targets.
	â€¢	Support for Other Attacks: The user information gathered can be used to build username lists for password attacks or privilege escalation attempts. ï¿¼ ï¿¼

3. How Does ident-user-enum Work?
	1.	It sends an Ident protocol query to the targetâ€™s port 113 (identd daemon).
	2.	Based on the response, the tool correlates each specified TCP port to the OS user that owns the listening process.
	3.	It outputs results like:

192.168.1.13:22   root
192.168.1.13:139  root
192.168.1.13:445  root

### 4. Example Use Case (Lab Scenario)

**Command:**

```bash
ident-user-enum 192.168.1.13 22 139 445

Output:

192.168.1.13:22    root
192.168.1.13:139   root
192.168.1.13:445   root

Interpretation:
	â€¢	Services on ports 22 (SSH), 139 (SMB), and 445 (SMB over TCP) are all running under the root user.
	â€¢	This suggests these services might be high-priority targets in penetration testing.

5. Practical Workflow

Installation:

sudo apt install ident-user-enum

Basic Usage:

ident-user-enum <target_ip> <port1> <port2> ...

Example:

ident-user-enum 10.11.1.136 22 113 139 445

This checks who is running services on those ports. ï¿¼

6. Limitations & Constraints
	â€¢	Reliant on identd: The target must have the ident service (RFC 1413) running and configured to allow queries.
	â€¢	Low Availability: Most modern systems disable ident by default due to privacy and security concerns.
	â€¢	Not Real-time: Only identifies who listens on a port, not who connected or is currently using it.
	â€¢	Risk of Detection: Ident can expose internal usernames and is considered noisyâ€”some systems may log or block such probes.

7. Summary
	â€¢	What: A Perl-based tool to map TCP ports to their owning OS user via the Ident protocol.
	â€¢	Why: Useful for understanding risk scope (e.g., root-level services) and building attacks.
	â€¢	How: Queries identd on port 113 and correlates the response with each port.
	â€¢	Use Case: Identified root users for SSH/SMB in lab, confirming elevated privileges.

In short:
ident-user-enum is a niche but effective tool for enumerating service owners on systems where identd is enabledâ€”great for legacy environments and CTFs. In modern environments, itâ€™s often replaced or supplemented by tools like pspy, lsof, or SMB enumeration scripts when permissions allow.
