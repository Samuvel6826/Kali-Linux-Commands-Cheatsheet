1) What is dnswalk?

dnswalk is a DNS database auditing and troubleshooting tool. It performs zone transfers and checks DNS data for consistency, correctness, and potential misconfigurations.

â¸»

2) Why use dnswalk?
	â€¢	To verify DNS records for errors, misconfigurations, and inconsistencies.
	â€¢	To attempt zone transfers and see if sensitive DNS data is exposed.
	â€¢	Useful for security auditors and network administrators to strengthen DNS security.

â¸»

3) How does dnswalk work?
	1.	You provide a domain name.
	2.	dnswalk queries DNS servers for available records.
	3.	It attempts a zone transfer (AXFR) and validates DNS data.
	4.	It reports issues such as:
	â€¢	Missing records
	â€¢	Duplicate entries
	â€¢	Syntax errors
	â€¢	Insecure configurations

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Context: Check DNS integrity for example.com.

Command:

dnswalk example.com

Flags:
	â€¢	-r â†’ Recursively descend sub-domains.
	â€¢	-d â†’ Debugging output.
	â€¢	-a â†’ Perform all tests (consistency, syntax, etc.).

Observed Response (example):

examining zone: example.com
; Checking SOA record...
; Checking NS records...
; No zone transfer allowed (AXFR refused).
; No errors found in example.com zone.

Interpretation:
	â€¢	SOA record â†’ The Start of Authority (who manages the domain).
	â€¢	NS records â†’ DNS name servers are verified.
	â€¢	AXFR refused â†’ Zone transfer blocked (good security practice).
	â€¢	No errors â†’ DNS zone configuration is consistent.

â¸»

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Install (if not pre-installed):

sudo apt update && sudo apt install dnswalk


	2.	Run dnswalk on a domain:

dnswalk -a example.com


	3.	If AXFR (zone transfer) is allowed, it will list all DNS records. Otherwise, it will return REFUSED, which is the secure case.

â¸»

6) Limitations
	â€¢	Requires zone transfer permission; most modern DNS servers block AXFR by default.
	â€¢	Cannot brute-force subdomains like dnsenum or dnsrecon.
	â€¢	Primarily checks data integrity, not enumeration.

â¸»

7) Summary
	â€¢	What: DNS auditing tool for integrity checks.
	â€¢	Why: To detect misconfigurations, insecure DNS setups, or accidental zone transfer exposure.
	â€¢	How: By querying DNS servers, attempting AXFR, and validating records.
	â€¢	Use Case: Tested with example.com â†’ No zone transfer, DNS records intact.

âš¡ This tool is best seen as a DNS auditor, while tools like dnsenum / dnsrecon are better for subdomain enumeration.
