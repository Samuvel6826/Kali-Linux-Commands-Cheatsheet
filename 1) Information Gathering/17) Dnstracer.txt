1) What is dnstracer?

dnstracer is a command-line tool that traces the path DNS queries take to resolve a given domain. It starts from a chosen DNS server (like root servers or public resolvers) and follows the delegation chain until it reaches the authoritative server for the target domain.

2) Why use dnstracer?
	â€¢	Understand how DNS resolution works step by step.
	â€¢	Identify where DNS issues (misconfigurations, delays) may occur.
	â€¢	See the delegation path from root servers â†’ TLD servers â†’ authoritative servers.
	â€¢	Useful for network troubleshooting and penetration testing (detecting DNS misconfigurations).

3) How does dnstracer work?
	1.	You provide a domain (e.g., example.com).
	2.	dnstracer queries a DNS server (default = your local resolver).
	3.	It traces through the DNS hierarchy until it reaches the authoritative nameserver.
	4.	Displays each server in the chain.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnstracer -s 8.8.8.8 example.com

Flags:
	â€¢	-s â†’ Start query from a specific DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8 = Google DNS, a.root-servers.net = root server).
	â€¢	-v â†’ Verbose mode (shows detailed responses).
	â€¢	-q â†’ Set query type (A, MX, NS, etc.).

Observed Output (Example):

Tracing to example.com[a] via 8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8 (google-public-dns-a.google.com) 
â†“
a.root-servers.net (Root Server) 
â†“
b.gtld-servers.net (.com TLD Server) 
â†“
ns.icann.org (Authoritative Server for example.com) 
â†“
example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34

Interpretation:
	â€¢	Each line shows a DNS server that participated in resolving the domain.
	â€¢	The last line is the authoritative server response with the final IP.

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Install dnstracer:

sudo apt install dnstracer

	2.	Trace domain resolution via Google DNS:

dnstracer -s 8.8.8.8 example.com

	3.	Trace via Root Servers for full delegation chain:

dnstracer -s a.root-servers.net example.com

	4.	Verbose output (detailed query/response):

dnstracer -v -s 8.8.8.8 example.com

6) Limitations
	â€¢	Wonâ€™t directly list subdomains (only shows resolution chain).
	â€¢	Output may vary if local DNS cache resolves the query instantly.
	â€¢	Cannot bypass DNSSEC or hidden authoritative setups.

â¸»

7) Summary
	â€¢	What: dnstracer shows the DNS delegation path for a domain.
	â€¢	Why: To analyze DNS resolution, troubleshoot misconfigurations, and study how queries flow.
	â€¢	How: Traces DNS servers from root/TLD to authoritative.
	â€¢	Use Case: Checked DNS resolution path for example.com.
