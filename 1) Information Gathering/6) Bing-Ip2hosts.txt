What is bing-ip2hosts?

bing-ip2hosts is a penetration testing tool used for reverse IP lookups. Given an IP address, it queries Bingâ€™s search engine to find domain names (hostnames) that resolve to the same IP. This helps identify other websites hosted on the same server.

Why is it used?
	â€¢	To discover virtual hosts sharing the same server/IP.
	â€¢	Useful for attack surface expansion (finding more possible targets).
	â€¢	Helps in shared hosting analysis to see what domains coexist on the same server.
	â€¢	Often used in penetration testing and reconnaissance stages to gather intelligence about a target.

How does it work?
	â€¢	The tool sends queries to Bing search engine with filters like ip:x.x.x.x.
	â€¢	Bing responds with domains indexed for that IP.
	â€¢	The tool collects and lists these domains.
	â€¢	Penetration testers can then check each domain for vulnerabilities.
