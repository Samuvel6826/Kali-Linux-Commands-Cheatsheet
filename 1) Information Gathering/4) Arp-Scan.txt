1) What is arp-scan?

arp-scan is a network discovery tool that identifies active devices on a local network by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests.
Unlike ICMP (ping)-based tools, it works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer), allowing it to detect hosts even when ICMP is blocked by firewalls.

⸻

2) Why use arp-scan?
	•	Quickly maps IP ↔ MAC address relationships on a subnet.
	•	Effective for host discovery in penetration testing and security assessments.
	•	Useful for network inventory or troubleshooting (detecting unknown devices).
	•	More reliable on local networks compared to ping sweeps.

⸻

3) How does arp-scan work?
	1.	Sends ARP requests to every IP address in the target subnet.
	2.	Hosts that are alive respond with their IP + MAC address.
	3.	Output lists all discovered devices, including their hardware addresses and (if available) vendor information.

⸻

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Context: Scanning from Kali Linux (VM in UTM) to detect devices on the local subnet (NAT mode).

Command:

sudo arp-scan -l

Flags explained:
	•	sudo → needed for raw socket access.
	•	arp-scan → tool command.
	•	-l → scan the entire local subnet of the active interface.

Sample Output:

192.168.64.1  76:a6:cd:eb:06:64  (Unknown: locally administered)

👉 This shows the host at 192.168.64.1 is alive, with MAC address 76:a6:cd:eb:06:64.

⚠️ Warning seen:

WARNING: Cannot open MAC/Vendor file ieee-oui.txt: Permission denied

Meaning vendor lookup failed due to permission issues. Can be fixed by adjusting file permissions or updating the OUI database.

⸻

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Scan local subnet:

sudo arp-scan -l


	2.	Scan a specific range:

sudo arp-scan 192.168.64.0/24


	3.	Save results for analysis:

sudo arp-scan -l > hosts.txt



⸻

6) Limitations
	•	Works only on local networks (cannot scan across routers).
	•	Vendor detection depends on the availability of the OUI database.
	•	Requires root privileges to function properly.

⸻

7) Summary
	•	What: A Layer 2 tool for active host discovery using ARP requests.
	•	Why: To identify all live hosts on a local subnet, even if ping is blocked.
	•	How: Sends ARP requests ➜ receives replies ➜ lists IP & MAC addresses.
	•	Use case shown: Detected devices in a NAT-based subnet of Kali VM (192.168.64.x).
