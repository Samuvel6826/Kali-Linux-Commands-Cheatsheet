1) What is cisco-torch?

cisco-torch is a mass scanner designed specifically for discovering and fingerprinting Cisco network devices.
It can scan for services such as Telnet, SSH, SNMP, HTTP, HTTPS, NTP, and TFTP and can also attempt dictionary-based attacks on these services.

‚∏ª

2) Why use cisco-torch?
	‚Ä¢	Quickly identify Cisco devices on a network.
	‚Ä¢	Enumerate running services (Telnet, SSH, SNMP, HTTP, HTTPS, NTP, TFTP).
	‚Ä¢	Perform service fingerprinting and vulnerability checks.
	‚Ä¢	Automate SNMP community string brute-forcing and TFTP config file leeching.
	‚Ä¢	Useful in penetration tests where Cisco equipment is deployed.

‚∏ª

3) How does cisco-torch work?
	1.	Uses forking to launch multiple scanning processes for efficiency.
	2.	Performs application-layer fingerprinting for accuracy.
	3.	Attempts service discovery and (optionally) brute force attacks on discovered services.
	4.	Can download Cisco configuration files if SNMP read-write communities are found.

‚∏ª

4) Exact Use Case (Example Command)

Command:

sudo cisco-torch -A 192.168.99.202

Flags explained:
	‚Ä¢	-A ‚Üí run all fingerprint scan types.
	‚Ä¢	-s ‚Üí scan Cisco SSH service.
	‚Ä¢	-t ‚Üí scan Cisco Telnet service.
	‚Ä¢	-u ‚Üí scan SNMP service.
	‚Ä¢	-w ‚Üí scan Cisco Webserver (HTTP).
	‚Ä¢	-c ‚Üí Cisco Webserver with SSL (HTTPS).
	‚Ä¢	-j ‚Üí TFTP fingerprinting.
	‚Ä¢	-n ‚Üí NTP fingerprinting.
	‚Ä¢	-g ‚Üí attempt to download config/TFTP file.
	‚Ä¢	-b ‚Üí perform dictionary attacks.
	‚Ä¢	-O ‚Üí save output to file.

Sample Output (from docs):

* Cisco by SNMP found ***
*System Description: Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
IOS (tm) 3600 Software (C3640-IK9O3S-M), Version 12.3(22), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)
Cisco-IOS Webserver found
 HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Server: cisco-IOS

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Discover Cisco devices in a subnet:

sudo cisco-torch -A 10.10.0.0/24


	2.	Scan only SSH with brute force using a host list:

sudo cisco-torch -s -b -F sshtocheck.txt


	3.	Scan Cisco webservers for HTTP Authorization vulnerability:

sudo cisco-torch -w -z 10.10.0.0/16



‚∏ª

6) Limitations
	‚Ä¢	Focused only on Cisco devices (not general-purpose like nmap).
	‚Ä¢	Requires root privileges for most scans.
	‚Ä¢	SNMP/TFTP brute force attempts may generate alerts on IDS/IPS systems.
	‚Ä¢	Some fingerprint DBs may be missing (e.g., fingerprint.db), requiring manual setup.

7) Status in Current Cybersecurity Workflow

‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated / Legacy Tool
	‚Ä¢	cisco-torch is not actively maintained in modern pentesting distributions.
	‚Ä¢	While it still exists in Kali Linux repos, professionals usually prefer tools like:
	‚Ä¢	nmap with NSE scripts for Cisco discovery.
	‚Ä¢	onesixtyone for SNMP sweeps.
	‚Ä¢	hydra/medusa for brute force attempts.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs mainly useful for educational labs or when working with older Cisco devices, but in real-world engagements, it‚Äôs rarely used today.

‚∏ª

8) Summary
	‚Ä¢	What: Specialized mass scanner for Cisco devices.
	‚Ä¢	Why: To discover Cisco hardware, enumerate services, and test for weak credentials or misconfigurations.
	‚Ä¢	How: Uses parallel scanning + fingerprinting + optional brute force.
	‚Ä¢	Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy/Deprecated ‚Äì replaced by nmap NSE, hydra, onesixtyone.
	‚Ä¢	Example: cisco-torch -A 192.168.99.202 identifies services and vulnerabilities on a Cisco router.
