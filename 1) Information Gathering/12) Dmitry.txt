1) What is DMitry?

DMitry is a lightweight command-line tool for reconnaissance. It can gather WHOIS data, Netcraft info, subdomains, emails, and open ports from a given domain/IP.

â¸»

2) Why use DMitry?
	â€¢	One tool â†’ multiple types of recon.
	â€¢	Helps map domain registration + hosting details.
	â€¢	Finds open services on a server.
	â€¢	Useful for footprinting phase in penetration testing.

â¸»

3) How does DMitry work?
	1.	Takes a domain/IP as input.
	2.	Queries WHOIS (domain + IP block).
	3.	Contacts Netcraft for hosting info.
	4.	Performs search-engine lookups for emails/subdomains.
	5.	Scans for open TCP ports.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dmitry -winsepo example.com

Flags used:
	â€¢	-w â†’ WHOIS lookup
	â€¢	-i â†’ IP WHOIS lookup
	â€¢	-n â†’ Netcraft data
	â€¢	-s â†’ Subdomain search
	â€¢	-e â†’ Email search
	â€¢	-p â†’ TCP port scan
	â€¢	-o â†’ Save results to file

Observed Results (sample output):

ðŸ”¹ Host Info:
	â€¢	Host IP â†’ 93.184.216.34
	â€¢	Hostname â†’ example.com

ðŸ”¹ Domain WHOIS (example.com):
	â€¢	Registrar: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
	â€¢	Created: 1995-08-14
	â€¢	Updated: 2023-08-14
	â€¢	Expiry: 2030-08-14
	â€¢	Status: Active
	â€¢	Nameservers: a.iana-servers.net, b.iana-servers.net

ðŸ”¹ Subdomain Search:
	â€¢	No additional subdomains found (search engines checked).

ðŸ”¹ Email Search:
	â€¢	No public emails found.

ðŸ”¹ TCP Port Scan (on 93.184.216.34):
	â€¢	80/tcp â†’ Open (HTTP)
	â€¢	443/tcp â†’ Open (HTTPS)
	â€¢	Other ports scanned â†’ Closed

Interpretation:
	â€¢	Domain is registered and active (till 2030).
	â€¢	Hosted by IANA on a stable infrastructure.
	â€¢	Only web-related services (HTTP/HTTPS) exposed.
	â€¢	No publicly discoverable subdomains/emails.

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Install:

sudo apt install dmitry


	2.	Run WHOIS only:

dmitry -w example.com


	3.	Run full scan:

dmitry -winsepo example.com


	4.	Check saved output:

cat example.com.txt

6) Limitations
	â€¢	Outdated subdomain/email search (Altavista no longer works).
	â€¢	No stealth â€“ scans can be logged by target servers.
	â€¢	Netcraft integration minimal (returns generic info).
	â€¢	Still okay for labs, but deprecated in professional workflows â†’ replaced by tools like theHarvester, Amass, Recon-ng.

â¸»

7) Summary
	â€¢	What: Recon tool combining WHOIS, DNS, Netcraft, email/subdomain searches, and port scan.
	â€¢	Why: Quick footprinting on domains/hosts.
	â€¢	How: Queries public databases + TCP scans.
	â€¢	Use case shown: Example.com â†’ Registrar info, DNS servers, IP, and two open ports (HTTP/HTTPS).
