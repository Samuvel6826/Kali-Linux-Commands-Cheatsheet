1) What is DMitry?

DMitry is a lightweight command-line tool for reconnaissance. It can gather WHOIS data, Netcraft info, subdomains, emails, and open ports from a given domain/IP.

⸻

2) Why use DMitry?
	•	One tool → multiple types of recon.
	•	Helps map domain registration + hosting details.
	•	Finds open services on a server.
	•	Useful for footprinting phase in penetration testing.

⸻

3) How does DMitry work?
	1.	Takes a domain/IP as input.
	2.	Queries WHOIS (domain + IP block).
	3.	Contacts Netcraft for hosting info.
	4.	Performs search-engine lookups for emails/subdomains.
	5.	Scans for open TCP ports.

⸻

4) Exact Use Case (Your Lab Example)

Command:

dmitry -winsepo pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com

Flags used:
	•	-w → WHOIS lookup
	•	-i → IP WHOIS lookup
	•	-n → Netcraft data
	•	-s → Subdomain search
	•	-e → Email search
	•	-p → TCP port scan
	•	-o → Save results to file

Observed Results:

🔹 Host Info:
	•	Host IP → 208.91.199.87
	•	Hostname → pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com

🔹 IP WHOIS (inetnum block):
	•	Range: 208.88.132.0 - 208.116.2.255
	•	Netname: NON-RIPE-NCC-MANAGED-ADDRESS-BLOCK
	•	Status: Allocated Unspecified
	•	Maintainer: RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT
	•	Country: EU (actually worldwide hosting allocation)
	•	Organization: IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

🔹 Domain WHOIS (pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com):
	•	Registrar: PDR Ltd. (PublicDomainRegistry.com)
	•	Created: 2014-10-17
	•	Updated: 2024-10-18
	•	Expiry: 2025-10-17
	•	Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited
	•	Nameservers:
	•	NS1.BH-15.WEBHOSTBOX.NET
	•	NS2.BH-15.WEBHOSTBOX.NET
	•	DNSSEC: unsigned

🔹 Netcraft Info:
	•	Request sent to Netcraft → “Information gathered” (basic placeholder, not detailed in this output).

🔹 Subdomain Search:
	•	Google.com & Altavista.com checked.
	•	Result: 0 subdomains found.

🔹 Email Search:
	•	Google.com & Altavista.com checked.
	•	Result: 0 emails found.

🔹 TCP Port Scan (on 208.91.199.87):
	•	21/tcp → Open (FTP)
	•	22/tcp → Open (SSH)
	•	25/tcp → Open (SMTP)
	•	26/tcp → Open (Alternate SMTP)
	•	53/tcp → Open (DNS)
	•	80/tcp → Open (HTTP)
	•	110/tcp → Open (POP3)
	•	143/tcp → Open (IMAP)
	•	140 other ports scanned → Closed

Interpretation:
	•	Domain is registered & active (till 2025).
	•	Hosted on a shared hosting provider block.
	•	Common mail + web hosting stack visible (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP, DNS).
	•	No publicly discoverable subdomains/emails.

⸻

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Install:

sudo apt install dmitry

	2.	Run WHOIS only:

dmitry -w example.com

	3.	Run full scan:

dmitry -winsepo example.com

	4.	Check saved output:

cat example.com.txt

⸻

6) Limitations
	•	Outdated subdomain/email search (Altavista no longer works).
	•	No stealth – scans can be logged by target servers.
	•	Netcraft integration minimal (returns generic “info gathered”).
	•	Still okay for labs, but deprecated in professional workflows → replaced by tools like theHarvester, Amass, Recon-ng.

⸻

7) Summary
	•	What: Recon tool combining WHOIS, DNS, Netcraft, email/subdomain searches, and port scan.
	•	Why: Quick footprinting on domains/hosts.
	•	How: Queries public databases + TCP scans.
	•	Use case shown: Found registrar, DNS, hosting IP range, and 8 open ports on target domain.
