1) What is copy-router-config?
copy-router-config is a network utility in Kali Linux used to download (backup) the running or startup configuration from a Cisco router using SNMP and TFTP. It helps in configuration auditing and backup for network security analysis.

â¸»

2) Why use copy-router-config?
â€¢ Backups: Safely store router configurations before making changes.
â€¢ Security Audits: Inspect configuration for vulnerabilities (weak passwords, ACLs).
â€¢ Disaster Recovery: Restore original configurations after crashes or misconfigurations.
â€¢ Compliance: Maintain configuration history for audits.

â¸»

3) How does copy-router-config work?
1. Uses SNMP protocol to connect to the Cisco router.
2. Requests the running-config or startup-config from the device.
3. Transfers the config to a TFTP server (usually your Kali machine).
4. Saves it as a text file for analysis or backup.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Context: You have a Cisco router at 192.168.1.1 and a Kali Linux machine acting as a TFTP server at 192.168.1.10.

Command:
copy-router-config --host 192.168.1.1 --community public --tftp 192.168.1.10

Flags:
â€¢ --host â†’ IP of the router
â€¢ --community â†’ SNMP community string (like a password; default is usually public)
â€¢ --tftp â†’ IP of the TFTP server (your Kali machine)

Observed Response:
Connecting to router 192.168.1.1
Requesting configuration...
Saving configuration to TFTP server 192.168.1.10
Configuration successfully copied.

Interpretation:
The running configuration of the Cisco router was successfully backed up to the TFTP server on Kali.

5) Practical Workflow
1. Install TFTP server on Kali
   sudo apt install atftpd
   sudo systemctl enable atftpd
   sudo systemctl start atftpd

2. Run copy-router-config to download the config
   copy-router-config --host <router-ip> --community <community> --tftp <kali-ip>

3. Check saved config in /var/lib/tftpboot/ on Kali.

4. (Optional) Restore configuration using:
   merge-router-config --host <router-ip> --community <community> --tftp <kali-ip> --file <backup.cfg>

6) Limitations
â€¢ Works only with Cisco routers supporting SNMP.
â€¢ Requires SNMP access and community string (not secure if misused).
â€¢ Needs TFTP server running and accessible.
â€¢ Can be detected by IDS/IPS (active SNMP queries).

â¸»

7) Summary
â€¢ What: Backup Cisco router configurations using SNMP and TFTP.
â€¢ Why: For auditing, backup, and recovery purposes.
â€¢ How: SNMP query â†’ Router sends config â†’ Stored on TFTP server.
â€¢ Use case shown: Backed up Cisco router config to Kali TFTP server.
