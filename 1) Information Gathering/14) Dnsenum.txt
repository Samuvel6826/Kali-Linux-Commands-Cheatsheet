1) What is dnsenum?

dnsenum is a DNS information-gathering tool that automates the process of:
	â€¢	Finding host IP addresses (A records)
	â€¢	Identifying Name Servers (NS records)
	â€¢	Discovering Mail Servers (MX records)
	â€¢	Attempting zone transfers
	â€¢	Brute forcing subdomains using a wordlist
	â€¢	Running WHOIS lookups on discovered IPs

â¸»

2) Why use dnsenum?
	â€¢	Helps map out a domainâ€™s DNS infrastructure.
	â€¢	Can reveal hidden subdomains (via brute-force).
	â€¢	Tests for misconfigured DNS servers (zone transfer).
	â€¢	Assists in the footprinting phase of penetration testing.

3) How does dnsenum work?
	1.	You provide a domain name.
	2.	It queries DNS records (A, MX, NS, etc.).
	3.	Attempts AXFR (zone transfer) on name servers.
	4.	Uses Google scraping & brute-force wordlists to find subdomains.
	5.	Performs WHOIS lookups and reverse DNS lookups.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnsenum --enum example.com

Observed Output (Sample Results):
	â€¢	Host Address:
	â€¢	example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34
	â€¢	Name Servers:
	â€¢	a.iana-servers.net â†’ 199.43.135.53
	â€¢	b.iana-servers.net â†’ 199.43.133.53
	â€¢	Mail Server (MX):
	â€¢	No MX records (example.com does not handle mail).
	â€¢	Zone Transfer:
	â€¢	Attempted â†’ AXFR failed (REFUSED) âœ… (this is expected for security).
	â€¢	Brute-forced Subdomains Found (if using a wordlist):
	â€¢	www.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34
	â€¢	ftp.example.com â†’ Not resolved (sample wordlist)
	â€¢	WHOIS / Reverse Lookup:
	â€¢	IP â†’ Registered with Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

â¸»

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Install dnsenum (if missing):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnsenum


	2.	Run full enumeration:

dnsenum --enum example.com


	3.	Try zone transfer only:

dnsenum --axfr example.com


	4.	Use a custom wordlist for brute-force:

dnsenum -f wordlist.txt example.com

6) Limitations
	â€¢	Zone transfers often fail (most servers refuse AXFR).
	â€¢	Google scraping may be blocked.
	â€¢	Subdomain discovery is limited by the quality of the wordlist.
	â€¢	WHOIS records may hide ownership details (due to privacy/GDPR).

7) Summary
	â€¢	What: dnsenum is a DNS reconnaissance tool.
	â€¢	Why: To gather DNS infrastructure info, discover subdomains, identify MX/NS records, and test for zone transfers.
	â€¢	How: Queries DNS records, brute-force subdomains, WHOIS, reverse lookups.
	â€¢	Use Case (Lab): Enumerated DNS records for example.com with NS records, IP address, and tested zone transfer.
