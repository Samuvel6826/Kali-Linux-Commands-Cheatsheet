1) What is dnsenum?

dnsenum is a DNS information-gathering tool that automates the process of:
	â€¢	Finding host IP addresses (A records)
	â€¢	Identifying Name Servers (NS records)
	â€¢	Discovering Mail Servers (MX records)
	â€¢	Attempting zone transfers
	â€¢	Brute forcing subdomains using a wordlist
	â€¢	Running WHOIS lookups on discovered IPs

â¸»

2) Why use dnsenum?
	â€¢	Helps map out a domainâ€™s DNS infrastructure.
	â€¢	Can reveal hidden subdomains (via brute-force).
	â€¢	Tests for misconfigured DNS servers (zone transfer).
	â€¢	Assists in footprinting during penetration testing.

3) How does dnsenum work?
	1.	You give it a domain name.
	2.	It queries DNS records (A, MX, NS, etc.).
	3.	Tries AXFR (zone transfer) on name servers.
	4.	Uses Google scraping & brute-force wordlists to find subdomains.
	5.	Runs WHOIS lookups and reverse DNS lookups.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

ðŸ”¹ Context: You want to enumerate the domain pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com.

Command:

dnsenum --enum pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com

ðŸ”¹ Observed Output (Summary):
	â€¢	Host Address:
pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com â†’ 208.91.199.87
	â€¢	Name Servers:
ns1.bh-15.webhostbox.net â†’ 208.91.199.87
ns2.bh-15.webhostbox.net â†’ 208.91.199.87
	â€¢	Mail Server:
pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com â†’ 208.91.199.87
	â€¢	Zone Transfer:
Attempted â†’ AXFR failed (REFUSED) âœ… (this is good security).
	â€¢	Brute-forced Subdomains Found:
	â€¢	ftp.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com â†’ 208.91.199.87
	â€¢	mail.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com â†’ Alias to main domain
	â€¢	webmail.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com â†’ 208.91.199.87
	â€¢	www.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com â†’ Alias to main domain
	â€¢	WHOIS / Reverse Lookup:
IP range found: 208.91.198.0/23

â¸»

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Install dnsenum (if missing):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnsenum


	2.	Run full enumeration:

dnsenum --enum example.com


	3.	Try zone transfer only:

dnsenum --axfr example.com


	4.	Use your own wordlist for brute-force:

dnsenum -f wordlist.txt example.com



â¸»

6) Limitations
	â€¢	Zone transfers often fail (most servers refuse AXFR).
	â€¢	Google scraping may be blocked (as in your scan).
	â€¢	Only as good as the subdomain wordlist.
	â€¢	Public WHOIS may hide ownership due to privacy protection.

7) Summary
	â€¢	What: dnsenum is a DNS reconnaissance tool.
	â€¢	Why: To gather DNS infrastructure info, subdomains, MX, NS, and test for zone transfers.
	â€¢	How: Queries DNS records, brute-force, WHOIS, reverse lookups.
	â€¢	Use Case: Enumerated DNS records for pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com with discovered subdomains.
