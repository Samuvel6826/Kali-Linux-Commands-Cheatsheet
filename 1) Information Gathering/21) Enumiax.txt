1. What is enumIAX?

enumIAX is a command-line tool that enumerates valid extensions on servers running the IAX protocol (Inter-Asterisk eXchange), which is widely used in VoIP systems based on Asterisk PBX.
It helps identify active VoIP accounts/extensions that could be leveraged for attacks such as brute-force or toll fraud.

⸻

2. Why use it?
	•	🔎 Discover valid VoIP extensions.
	•	🔐 Assess PBX/Asterisk server security posture.
	•	⚠️ Identify accounts vulnerable to password brute-force.
	•	📞 Valuable in VoIP penetration tests and telecom security audits.

⸻

3. How does enumIAX work?
	1.	Sends crafted IAX requests to a target PBX server.
	2.	Iterates through a list or range of possible extensions.
	3.	Analyzes server responses to determine which extensions exist.
	4.	Reports discovered valid extensions.

4. Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

enumiax -d 10.10.10.50 -u 1000-1100

Explanation:
	•	-d → Target IP/domain (e.g., PBX server).
	•	-u → Range of extensions (1000–1100).

Sample Output (Lab):

[+] Extension 1001 found
[+] Extension 1005 found
[-] Extension 1010 not valid

Interpretation:
	•	Extensions 1001 and 1005 are active.
	•	An attacker could attempt password brute-force against these accounts.

5. Practical Workflow
	•	Enumerate with numeric range:

enumiax -d targetpbx.com -u 200-300


	•	Use custom wordlist:

enumiax -d targetpbx.com -w extensions.txt


	•	Verbose output:

enumiax -d targetpbx.com -u 1000-1100 -v

6. Limitations / Constraints

⚠️ Important constraints in real-world use:
	•	Works only against IAX protocol (not SIP).
	•	Requires the target to be a PBX/Asterisk server with IAX enabled.
	•	Running it against normal web domains (e.g., example.com) produces no results (since no IAX service exists).
	•	On a Mac/Kali setup, you can run the tool, but to see meaningful results, you must test against a lab PBX (e.g., Asterisk in a VM/Docker).
	•	Not a brute-forcer → it only discovers valid extensions, not passwords.
	•	May trigger alerts in VoIP IDS/IPS systems.

⸻

7. Summary
	•	What: Enumerates VoIP/IAX extensions on PBX servers.
	•	Why: Helps detect exposed/valid accounts for VoIP security audits.
	•	How: Sends IAX extension probes and checks responses.
	•	Use Case: On example.com → no results (no IAX service). On a lab PBX → valid extensions can be enumerated.

⸻

👉 In short:
enumIAX is mainly useful in VoIP security labs/CTFs. In real-world pentests, it’s often combined with SIPVicious, svmap, and Nmap SIP scripts for complete VoIP footprinting.
