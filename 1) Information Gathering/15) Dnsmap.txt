----------------------------------------------------
1) What is DNSMAP?
DNSMAP is a subdomain brute-forcing tool used to discover subdomains of a target domain. 
It uses a wordlist-based approach to guess possible subdomains and resolves them to IP addresses if they exist.

----------------------------------------------------
2) Why use DNSMAP?
â€¢ To discover hidden or internal subdomains of a domain.
â€¢ Helps in attack surface mapping for penetration testing.
â€¢ Works well with other reconnaissance tools like dnsenum.

----------------------------------------------------
3) How does DNSMAP work?
1. You provide a domain name and a wordlist.
2. DNSMAP appends each word from the list as a possible subdomain.
3. It sends DNS queries for each subdomain.
4. Displays valid subdomains that resolve to an IP address.

----------------------------------------------------
4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)
Context: You want to find subdomains of example.com using a wordlist.

Command:
dnsmap example.com

Optional flags:
- -w â†’ Path to custom wordlist.
- -r â†’ Recursive brute force.
- -d â†’ Delay between requests.

Example with custom wordlist and delay:
dnsmap example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt -d 3

----------------------------------------------------
5) Expected Output:
dnsmap 0.30 - DNS Network Mapper

[+] target domain: example.com
[+] using built-in wordlist
[+] resolving subdomains:
-------------------------------------
Found: mail.example.com -> 93.184.216.120
Found: www.example.com  -> 93.184.216.119
Found: ftp.example.com  -> 93.184.216.121
-------------------------------------
[+] Total valid subdomains found: 3

----------------------------------------------------
6) How to interpret results:
â€¢ 'Found:' Indicates the subdomain exists and is live.
â€¢ The IP address shown is where the subdomain resolves to.

----------------------------------------------------
7) Practical Workflow:
1. Run dnsmap with the default list:
   dnsmap example.com
2. Use a custom wordlist for better results:
   dnsmap example.com -w /path/to/customlist.txt
3. Add delay to avoid detection or rate-limiting:
   dnsmap example.com -d 2

----------------------------------------------------
8) Limitations:
â€¢ Only works based on the wordlist quality.
â€¢ Does not use DNS zone transfer or WHOIS (unlike dnsenum).
â€¢ Brute force can be slow for large lists.

----------------------------------------------------
9) Summary:
â€¢ What: DNSMAP finds subdomains using brute force.
â€¢ Why: To uncover hidden subdomains and expand attack surface.
â€¢ How: Wordlist-based brute force âžœ DNS query âžœ Valid subdomains.
â€¢ Use Case: Found mail, www, and ftp subdomains for example.com.
