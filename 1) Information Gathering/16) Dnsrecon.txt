1) What is dnsrecon?

dnsrecon is a DNS enumeration and reconnaissance tool that performs comprehensive DNS record gathering, zone transfers, brute-forcing, and DNSSEC checks. It is more feature-rich and flexible than dnsenum.

‚∏ª

2) Why use dnsrecon?
	‚Ä¢	Detects DNS misconfigurations (zone transfers, outdated BIND versions).
	‚Ä¢	Collects A, MX, NS, SOA, TXT, and SRV records.
	‚Ä¢	Supports reverse lookups on IP ranges.
	‚Ä¢	Helps with security assessments by showing how much DNS data is publicly available.

‚∏ª

3) How does dnsrecon work?
	1.	You specify a domain.
	2.	It queries authoritative name servers.
	3.	Collects DNS records: A, MX, TXT, NS, SOA, etc.
	4.	Attempts zone transfers.
	5.	Optionally brute-forces subdomains with a wordlist.

‚∏ª

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

üîπ Context: Run general enumeration on pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com.

Command:

dnsrecon -d pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com

üîπ Observed Output (Summary):
	‚Ä¢	DNSSEC: Not configured.
	‚Ä¢	SOA Record:
ns1.bh-15.webhostbox.net ‚Üí 208.91.199.87
	‚Ä¢	Name Servers (NS):
ns1.bh-15.webhostbox.net ‚Üí 208.91.199.87
ns2.bh-15.webhostbox.net ‚Üí 208.91.199.87
	‚Ä¢	Bind Version Leak:
Both servers revealed ‚Üí "BIND 9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-26.P2.el7_9.16"
‚ö†Ô∏è (Fingerprinting risk ‚Äì attackers can look up known exploits for this version).
	‚Ä¢	Mail Server (MX):
pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com ‚Üí 208.91.199.87
	‚Ä¢	A Record (Website):
pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com ‚Üí 208.91.199.87
	‚Ä¢	TXT Records:
	‚Ä¢	SPF Policy ‚Üí v=spf1 a mx include:webhostbox.net ~all
	‚Ä¢	Google Site Verification ‚Üí ONr6SctwBgqa2NBmC08LAKbbiqNAvVd4Jw1iLzdMUtM
	‚Ä¢	SRV Records: None found.

‚∏ª

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Run basic DNS enumeration:

dnsrecon -d example.com


	2.	Attempt zone transfer:

dnsrecon -d example.com -t axfr


	3.	Reverse lookup on an IP range:

dnsrecon -r 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255


	4.	Brute force subdomains with a custom wordlist:

dnsrecon -d example.com -D wordlist.txt -t brt



‚∏ª

6) Limitations
	‚Ä¢	Zone transfer success depends on misconfigured DNS servers.
	‚Ä¢	Requires internet or network access to query DNS records.
	‚Ä¢	Google scraping may be blocked (similar to dnsenum).

‚∏ª

7) Summary
	‚Ä¢	What: dnsrecon = DNS record enumeration tool.
	‚Ä¢	Why: To detect leaks in DNS info, misconfigurations, and hidden services.
	‚Ä¢	How: Queries DNS records, checks DNSSEC, attempts zone transfer, brute-forces subdomains.
	‚Ä¢	Use Case: Discovered NS, MX, TXT, and even BIND version leaks for pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Key difference:
	‚Ä¢	dnsenum ‚Üí brute-force & wordlist-focused, older.
	‚Ä¢	dnsrecon ‚Üí modern, can also fingerprint versions (like BIND), checks DNSSEC, more flexible.
