1) What is dnsrecon?

dnsrecon is a DNS enumeration and reconnaissance tool that performs comprehensive DNS record gathering, zone transfers, brute-forcing, and DNSSEC checks. It is more feature-rich and flexible than dnsenum.

‚∏ª

2) Why use dnsrecon?
	‚Ä¢	Detects DNS misconfigurations (zone transfers, outdated BIND versions).
	‚Ä¢	Collects A, MX, NS, SOA, TXT, and SRV records.
	‚Ä¢	Supports reverse lookups on IP ranges.
	‚Ä¢	Helps with security assessments by showing how much DNS data is publicly available.

‚∏ª

3) How does dnsrecon work?
	1.	You specify a domain.
	2.	It queries authoritative name servers.
	3.	Collects DNS records: A, MX, TXT, NS, SOA, etc.
	4.	Attempts zone transfers (AXFR).
	5.	Optionally brute-forces subdomains with a wordlist.

‚∏ª

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnsrecon -d example.com

Observed Output (Sample Results):
	‚Ä¢	DNSSEC: Not configured.
	‚Ä¢	SOA Record:
	‚Ä¢	a.iana-servers.net ‚Üí 199.43.135.53
	‚Ä¢	Name Servers (NS):
	‚Ä¢	a.iana-servers.net ‚Üí 199.43.135.53
	‚Ä¢	b.iana-servers.net ‚Üí 199.43.133.53
	‚Ä¢	Mail Server (MX):
	‚Ä¢	None (example.com does not handle mail).
	‚Ä¢	A Record (Website):
	‚Ä¢	example.com ‚Üí 93.184.216.34
	‚Ä¢	TXT Records:
	‚Ä¢	‚Äúv=spf1 -all‚Äù (SPF policy rejecting mail).
	‚Ä¢	SRV Records:
	‚Ä¢	None found.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: In real-world targets, dnsrecon may also leak BIND version info from misconfigured DNS servers.

‚∏ª

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Run basic DNS enumeration:

dnsrecon -d example.com


	2.	Attempt zone transfer:

dnsrecon -d example.com -t axfr


	3.	Reverse lookup on an IP range:

dnsrecon -r 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255


	4.	Brute-force subdomains with a custom wordlist:

dnsrecon -d example.com -D wordlist.txt -t brt



‚∏ª

6) Limitations
	‚Ä¢	Zone transfer success depends on DNS server misconfiguration (rare today).
	‚Ä¢	Requires internet or network access to query DNS records.
	‚Ä¢	Brute-forcing depends on the quality of the wordlist.
	‚Ä¢	Google scraping (if enabled) may be blocked.

‚∏ª

7) Summary
	‚Ä¢	What: dnsrecon = DNS record enumeration tool.
	‚Ä¢	Why: To detect leaks in DNS info, misconfigurations, and hidden services.
	‚Ä¢	How: Queries DNS records, checks DNSSEC, attempts zone transfer, brute-forces subdomains.
	‚Ä¢	Use Case (Lab): Enumerated DNS for example.com and confirmed NS, SOA, TXT, and A records.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Key difference:
	‚Ä¢	dnsenum ‚Üí brute-force & wordlist-focused, older.
	‚Ä¢	dnsrecon ‚Üí modern, also fingerprints DNS versions (BIND), checks DNSSEC, more flexible.
