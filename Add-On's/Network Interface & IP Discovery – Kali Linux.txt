✅ Acknowledgement: Network Interface & IP Discovery – Kali Linux

I have successfully explored and practiced commands to identify both internal (private) and external (public) IP addresses in Kali Linux.

⸻

🔧 Practical Context:
This test was performed from a Kali Linux VM to gather information about local network interfaces, assigned IP addresses, and the system’s public IP for reconnaissance and networking setup verification.

⸻

📌 Steps Performed:
	•	Checked network interfaces & assigned IPs using:

ip a

Output showed:
	•	Loopback interface (lo) – IP: 127.0.0.1
	•	Ethernet interface (eth0) – Private IP: 192.168.64.2/24
	•	Multiple IPv6 addresses (global & link-local).

	•	Fetched public IP address using:

curl ifconfig.me

Output: 117.200.177.224 (Public IP).

	•	Listed internal IP addresses only using:

hostname -I

Output: 192.168.64.2 (private) + IPv6 addresses.

⸻

🔍 Explanation of Commands:
	•	ip a → Displays all network interfaces with IPv4 & IPv6 addresses.
	•	curl ifconfig.me → Retrieves the public IP address from an external service.
	•	hostname -I → Lists only assigned IP addresses (no extra interface details).

⸻

🧠 Concepts Learned:
	•	Private IPs (e.g., 192.168.x.x) are used within LAN and are not directly accessible from the internet.
	•	Public IPs are assigned by ISPs and are visible on the internet.
	•	IPv6 addresses can be global, temporary, or link-local.
	•	These commands are essential for network troubleshooting and reconnaissance in penetration testing.

💻 Environment Setup:
	•	Host Machine: macOS (M2 Chip)
	•	Guest OS: Kali Linux (ARM64 – 2025 Edition)
	•	Virtualization: UTM (QEMU)
	•	Network Mode: NAT
	•	Interface Used: eth0
