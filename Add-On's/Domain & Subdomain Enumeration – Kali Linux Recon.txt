‚úÖ Acknowledgement: Domain & Subdomain Enumeration ‚Äì Kali Linux Recon
üîó https://www.hackertarget.com/hostsearch/

I have successfully explored and practiced domain and subdomain enumeration techniques in Kali Linux to identify publicly available subdomains, gather IP addresses, and collect hosting information for a target domain.

‚∏ª

üîß Practical Context:
This reconnaissance was performed from a Kali Linux terminal to gather open-source intelligence (OSINT) on a public website (pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com). The goal was to enumerate associated subdomains, detect hosting providers, and identify underlying technologies for security assessment practice.

‚∏ª

üìå Steps Performed:
	‚Ä¢	Used Hackertarget Host Search API to enumerate subdomains:

curl -s "https://api.hackertarget.com/hostsearch/?q=pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com"

Example Output:

cpanel.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com,208.91.199.87  
cpcalendars.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com,208.91.199.87  
cpcontacts.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com,208.91.199.87  
webdisk.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com,208.91.199.87  
webmail.pioneerkumaraswamycollege.com,208.91.199.87  

	‚Ä¢	Performed HTTP header inspection using curl -I for cPanel & Webmail subdomains to reveal server type, cookies, and cache settings.
	‚Ä¢	Queried WHOIS for IP ownership and hosting details:

208.91.199.87 ‚Üí Hosted by PDR (PublicDomainRegistry), USA

	‚Ä¢	Ran WhatWeb for technology fingerprinting:

Bootstrap 4.5.0, 5.3.0  
jQuery 3.5.1, 3.6.0  
nginx/1.25.5  
Country: Virgin Islands (British)  
Email Found: pioneercollege67@gmail.com  

‚∏ª

üîç Explanation of Tools & Commands:
	‚Ä¢	curl: Fetches content or headers from URLs.
	‚Ä¢	Hackertarget Hostsearch: API to find subdomains & their IPs.
	‚Ä¢	WHOIS: Retrieves ownership & registration details of IP/domain.
	‚Ä¢	WhatWeb: Fingerprints technologies used by websites.

‚∏ª

üß† Concepts Learned:
	‚Ä¢	Subdomain enumeration helps identify additional attack surfaces.
	‚Ä¢	HTTP headers can reveal server versions & security configurations.
	‚Ä¢	WHOIS data can provide hosting provider and network details.
	‚Ä¢	Technology fingerprinting is critical for selecting relevant exploits in penetration testing.

‚∏ª

üíª Environment Setup:
	‚Ä¢	Host Machine: macOS (M2 Chip)
	‚Ä¢	Guest OS: Kali Linux (ARM64 ‚Äì 2025 Edition)
	‚Ä¢	Virtualization: UTM (QEMU)
	‚Ä¢	Network Mode: NAT
	‚Ä¢	Tools Used: curl, Hackertarget API, WhatWeb, WHOIS
