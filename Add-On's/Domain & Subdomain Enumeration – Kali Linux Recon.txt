âœ… Acknowledgement: Domain & Subdomain Enumeration â€“ Kali Linux Recon
ðŸ”— Official Reference: Hackertarget HostSearch

1) What is Subdomain Enumeration?

Subdomain enumeration is the process of identifying subdomains associated with a domain. These subdomains often host additional services (webmail, cPanel, API servers, admin panels) that expand the attack surface.

â¸»

2) Why use it?
	â€¢	Subdomains = extra entry points (often less secure than the main site).
	â€¢	Helps understand server structure & hosting providers.
	â€¢	Critical for OSINT & Penetration Testing workflows.

â¸»

3) How does it work?
	1.	Query subdomain search APIs (e.g., Hackertarget).
	2.	Collect associated IP addresses.
	3.	Inspect HTTP headers with curl -I.
	4.	Perform WHOIS to check ownership/hosting.
	5.	Run fingerprinting (e.g., WhatWeb) to detect frameworks & versions.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command (subdomain enumeration):

curl -s "https://api.hackertarget.com/hostsearch/?q=example.com"

Observed Output (Example):

cpanel.example.com,93.184.216.34
webmail.example.com,93.184.216.34
ftp.example.com,93.184.216.34

Next steps:
	â€¢	Checked headers:

curl -I http://cpanel.example.com

	â€¢	WHOIS for IP 93.184.216.34: Hosted by IANA / Reserved for documentation.
	â€¢	WhatWeb Fingerprinting:
	â€¢	nginx/1.25.x
	â€¢	Bootstrap 4.5.0
	â€¢	jQuery 3.6.0

â¸»

5) Practical Workflow
	1.	Find subdomains:

curl -s "https://api.hackertarget.com/hostsearch/?q=example.com"

	2.	Inspect headers:

curl -I http://subdomain.example.com

	3.	WHOIS check:

whois 93.184.216.34

	4.	Technology fingerprint:

whatweb example.com

6) Limitations
	â€¢	Hackertarget API is rate-limited (too many queries â†’ blocked).
	â€¢	Only shows publicly indexed subdomains (not hidden ones).
	â€¢	WhatWeb may miss obfuscated/minified JS frameworks.
	â€¢	Professional testers often use Amass, Sublist3r, assetfinder for deeper scans.

â¸»

7) Summary
	â€¢	What: Subdomain & domain recon using Hackertarget + WhatWeb.
	â€¢	Why: Identify hidden subdomains, hosting provider, technologies, and contact emails.
	â€¢	How: Queried API, checked headers, fingerprinted stack.
	â€¢	Use case shown: Found active subdomains, detected server stack (nginx + Bootstrap + jQuery), and confirmed hosting.

ðŸ‘‰ This complements other recon tools:
	â€¢	DMitry â†’ WHOIS + ports.
	â€¢	Hackertarget + WhatWeb â†’ Subdomains + tech stack.
	â€¢	Amass/Sublist3r â†’ More comprehensive modern enumeration.

âœ… Real-world note:
	â€¢	DMitry = legacy/basic â†’ good for labs.
	â€¢	Hackertarget & modern tools = practical OSINT sources.
	â€¢	Today, Hackertarget is often used in combination with Amass, Sublist3r, Recon-ng for professional bug bounty and pentesting.
